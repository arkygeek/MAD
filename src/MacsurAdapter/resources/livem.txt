Major challenges for the Livestock Sub-Theme are:

1 Identify, evaluate and increase the accessibility of relevant datasets for grasslands, livestock production and climate change

2 Compare models at a variety of spatial scales such as grass growth, grasslands and livestock production systems (including infectious disease) and assess model robustness and uncertainty in their estimates

3 Integrate models across scales with a central focus on adaptation but consideration also of mitigation measures and potential trade-offs

4 Disseminate outcomes to inform policymakers, stakeholders and end-users

5 Undertake cross-cutting activities with other themes and integrate whenever possible livestock models with crop and socio-economic models in case studies and integrated pilot studies
