Sheet,Variable,Explanation,ICASA_standard
all,Introduction:,"This spreadsheet contains the full list of variables and codes used in the ICASA standards. A general description of the standards is available at www.icasa.net/standards. The assumption is that the standards will evolve through time, especially through addition of new variables and codes.",1
all,AgMIP note:,A value of 2 in the ICASA_standard field indicates that the variable is included in the AgMIP standard.,2
