Thinking that there should be a member/pin for anything to get uploaded (for example dataset quality classifications).

A written record of my journey as I attempt to get files writing to xml files!

Step 1.   Choose something simple to begin with.
Step 2.   display the xml to screen first, before attempting to write file

So, for step 1 I think a good place to start will be to generate a file with just the dataset Name, Description, and theme selected.  As for displaying it to the screen, I think I will abandon that, as it would just be more work, and the code is already in place for writing and reading files.  I will check the files manually...
